# WAVPlayer

A simple Player that reads every .wav file in the directory /wavFiles, which will be created if missing.
The Player will store the user data in JSON files in the /userData directory. 

In the directory /Resources there are the .png files for the Player's icons, and a sample .wav file for the tests.
